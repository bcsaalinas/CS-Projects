        <h2>🏎️ OUR ORIGIN STORY 🏎️</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
          <p>
            🚗💨 Born from the asphalt and adrenaline of the underground street
            racing scene, Taco Turbo isn't just a restaurant - it's a
            BROTHERHOOD. Founded by a crew of traffic swimmers who mastered the
            art of weaving through lanes at 120mph and couldn't find decent grub
            after midnight street runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            💀 We realized the sickest stories get told over greasy tacos in
            empty parking lots at 3 AM, engines still ticking from fresh
            burnouts. So we built the ultimate pit stop where REAL drivers,
            traffic swimmers, and street legends could refuel their bodies and
            their souls. This is where you come when you've just threaded the
            needle between two semis at triple digits and need to calm your
            heart rate with some legendary fuel. 🌮⚡
